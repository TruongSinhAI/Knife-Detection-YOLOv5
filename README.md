# Knife-Detection-YOLOv5

The project focuses on using the YOLOv5 model for knife detection in photos and videos. YOLOv5, based on the YOLO architecture, is chosen for its real-time object detection capabilities. Key points include discussing model architecture, training procedure, performance assessment, layer selection, and the model's benefits and drawbacks. The report concludes with recommendations for improving performance and reducing false positives in knife detection.

The data we used from github: [https://github.com/ari-dasci/OD-WeaponDetection/tree/master/Knife_detection](url)
